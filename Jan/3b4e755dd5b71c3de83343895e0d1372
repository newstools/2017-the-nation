Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi on Tuesday appointed former Agriculture minister Kipruto arap Kirwa his deputy.Mr Mudavadi, who is eyeing the presidency, said this was a sign the party was growing stronger in numbers as the General Election draws closer. Our numbers in terms of membership and aspirants are growing by the day. We are building bridges and growing networks as we prepare for the General Election, said the party leader.He touted Mr Kirwa as a competent leader who had not only held a ministerial position but also served as an ambassador in former President Mwai Kibaki s government. He has serious political assets that will be useful in growing and developing the party, said Mr Mudavadi, adding that Mr Kirwa would be running for the Trans Nzoia senatorial seat.Mr Kirwa had decamped from New Ford-Kenya, which later merged with others to form the Jubilee Party.But he has been away from active politics for a while, and when asked if he still has enough political clout, he said he had only taken a sabbatical. We are back in town and we want to do politics. We may not agree in politics, but let us accept that the country belongs to us and we can t afford to do what the other side is doing trying to jeopardise elections, he said.He took a swipe at Jubilee on the election Bill signed into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday evening.He said that after a long soul searching he had settled for ANC.The party also received William Kirwa, a former managing director at the Agricultural Development Corporation, who plans to vie for the Lang ata parliamentary seat, and Amina Keinan, a former nurse, who seeks the Garissa County woman representative's position. email print email print Residents accuse Ken Obura of supporting President Kenyatta&#039;s Jubilee Party.
