CHICAGOPresident Barack Obama addressed America and the world for the final time as president Tuesday, in a speech that was both a tearful goodbye and a call to arms.Capping his eight years in the White House, Obama returned to his adoptive hometown of Chicago to recast his "yes we can" campaign credo as "yes we did."Listing landmarks of his presidency from the Iran nuclear deal to reforming healthcare much of the speech was dedicated to lifting up supporters shaken by Donald Trump's shock election.Obama called on them to pick up the torch, fight for democracy and forge a new "social compact".Auma Obama (centre), Malia Obama (right), eldest daughter of US President Barack Obama, walk to board Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on January 10, 2017 before departing for Chicago where Mr Obama delivered his farewell address.

"We rise or fall as one.""All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions."The incoming Republican president has smashed conventions, vowed to efface Obama's legacy and hurled personal insults left and right, while in a virtually unprecedented move US intelligence has accused the Kremlin of seeking to tip the election in Trump's favour.Democrats, cast into the political wilderness with the loss of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives plus a majority of statehouses, are struggling to regroup.Obama painted the task ahead as a generational challenge.US President Barack Obama delivers his farewell address to the American people at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, USA, 10 January 2017.

"Obama's last trip on Air Force One was a pilgrimage to his adoptive hometown, where he addressed a sell-out crowd of some 18,000 not far from where he delivered his victory speech eight years ago.Diehard fans many African Americans braved Chicago's frigid winter to collect free tickets, which were selling for upwards of $1,000 a piece on Craigslist.They were joined by First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill who the president described as "family" in an emotional finale to his speech.First lady Michelle Obama hugs US President Barack Obama after his farewell address to the American people at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, USA, 10 January 2017.

"A new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. You've made me proud. You've made the country proud."With an approval rating hovering around 55 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, Obama still carries considerable political weight.Some 51 percent of Americans polled believe that Trump is doing a bad job as president-elect.Trump's unorthodox politics have thrown the 55-year-old Obama's transition and post-presidency plans into flux.Having vowed a smooth handover of power, Obama has found himself being increasingly critical of Trump as he prepares to leave office on January 20.US President Barack Obama greets supporters after delivering his farewell address to the American people at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, USA, 10 January 2017.
